# DarkPatterns.Json.Specifications

This project is a work-in-progress.

Provides a set of abstractions for loading and working with JSON specification
documents in an abstract way that corresponds to the JSON Schema standard.

When loading a file, a default dialect is provided, which specifies the
vocabularies and keywords available when working with the document.
